# Testing in Javscript 

We are covering all different type of testing in javascript in Node JS/ React or Angular JS, Unit Testing in JavaScript with Mocha. Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach to development that consists of writing tests, followed by production code, and refactoring as needed. The tests are written to fail initially, and the developer writes code to fulfill the requirements of the test so they pass.

  - Unit Testing using mocha, Chai, Enjyme or any other Library
  - API Testing using postman/numan-cli
  - E2E Testing using Protractor
